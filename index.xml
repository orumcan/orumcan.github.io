      <description>Role: Technical Designer &amp;amp; Game Direction  Conga Line was a project that I came up with during my time on the Ideation Team at Paladin Studios.
  The goal was to have followers that&amp;rsquo;ll mimic the movement and the actions of the leader (player character) and solve the puzzles and pass the platforming challenges.
My initial assumption was that just seeing a line of followers behind you, taking the exact steps that you take would be fun to see and hopefully it would be fun to manage this snake-like line that you&amp;rsquo;ve created.</description>
